- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
  Cortana , GoogleAssistant , Siri , Alexa
  
- MACHINE LEARNING
  It is an approach to implement ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
  Google's search engine learns that users have spent a pretty good time on a web page , which means it is relevant result for given query and give it a vote up for future search. 
  This result is then shown on first page depending on number of votes for smiilar queries.
  However if an user spends a few seconds , it is not a relevant information for given query and give it a vote down for future search.
  This result is moved down depending on number of votes for similar queries.
  
  - It enables machines to take decision on their own based on past data.
  - Needs smaller amount of training data.
  - Works well on low-end systems.
  - Most features need to be identified in advance and manually coded.
  - Problem is divided into parts and solved individually then combined.
  - Testing takes longer.
  - Crisp rules explain why a decision was taken.
  
- DEEP LEARNING
  A subset of MACHINE LEARNING which uses artificial NEURAL NETWORKS.
  A scenario where a black and white picture is turned into a colored picture.
  It uses a model where it recognises people , objects in picture and assigns them a color.
  
  - It enables machines to take decisions with help of artificial NEURAL NETWORKS.
  - Needs larger amount of training data.
  - Needs high-end systems.
  - Machine learns features from data it is provided with.
  - Problem is solved in an end to end manner.
  - Testing takes less time.
  - Since system takes decisions based on it's own logic, reasoning may be difficult to interpret.
  
  
  
  
AI  with  ML  with  Deep Learning
-------------------------------------
- A scenario where a printed book is translated to a digital form.
  Translation of printed data to digital form using Deep Learning.
  Digital data is analysed and tagged ie Text mining is done to determine genre using Machine Learning.
  The book is identified using tagged genre using Artificial Intelligence.
  
  
  
  
Types of AI
-------------------------
- Reactive Machines
  systems that react , do not have memory and do not use any past experiences for new decision.
  
- Limited Memory
  systems do look at past experiences but over a limited data set to categorize depending on certain parameters.
  
- Theory of Mind
  syatems understand humans state of mind , decision making and act appropriately.
  
- Self Awareness
  systems do understand their own internal states , predict and act appropriately.
  
  
  
  
Types of MACHINE LEARNING
-----------------------------
- A technique where machines can learn , reason from past data to classify a new data.
- A machine learning model is given an input (data) and returns an output , if it is correct it is accepted , else it is given back to machine for retraining.
- Ways in which machine can learn:
  1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
     Machine learns from labeled data set where it knows features and labels associated with those features in a given data set. 
     It is more like a key-value pair for data provided.
     It is used to provide an output from given data set.
     
  2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
     Machine learns from unlabeled data set which is plotted and then machine labels the clusters of this data.
     Systems are able to identify hidden patterns from input data and make them organized to provide similarities , anomalities.
     When new data point is provided it checks from labeled clusters and then add it to respective cluster.
     It is used to determine patterns in given data set.
     
  3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
     Also called reward based learning where machine learns from feedback (reward or punishment) provided.
     
- Which machine learning model/algorithm to use depends on:
  - Problem statement
  - Size, quality, nature of data
  - Complexity of algorithm
  
- Machine Learning Algorithms
  1. Classification
     To predict outputs as "True/False" , "Yes/No" , "A/B"
     - Decision Tree              - a graph that uses branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision.
     - Naive Bayes                - depending on probabilities of events
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression
     - KNN (K Nearest Neighbours) - depending on K (an integer) the unknown data point is assigned an organised or labelled cluster.
     
  2. Regression  (Supervised Learning)
     To predict values (quantitative) , example : "Stock Price prediction"
     - Linear regression          - a regression line is drawn such that D () is minimum and good predictions.
     
  3. Clustering  (Unsupervised Learning)
     To find patterns from data and organize it , example : "Product recommendation"
     - K Means
